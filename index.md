**Do you have time series data that you need to leverage to its full potential?**

Feel free to e-mail me for an initial discussion on exactly how I can help you. With over five years of experience in using Python and R, I have used time series analysis to implement business intelligence solutions across a variety of industries. I am also involved in a range of research initiatives pertaining to time series analysis, and have presented my work at international conferences.

Some examples of time series projects I have worked on include:

- Panel data modelling for a major financial institution
- Sales forecasting and analysis across a variety of industries
- Road traffic modelling for a local governmental authority
